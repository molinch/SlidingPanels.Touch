Readme
-----------------------

This fork allows you to have menus on top of the current view controller.

You can then have alpha transparency in your menus.

Translucency effect, like in iOS7 navigation bar, has also been added. See screenshot: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bldw2JYCMAA1gkC.png

The translucency is applied on top of elements while the menu is slided by the user.


Original Readme from Pat
-------------------------

This is a library providing sliding panels (often called Hamburger menus or Flyout menus) to a monotouch app, much like the Facebook iOS left and right panels.

This has been tested on iPhone and iPad and currently seems to be working pretty well.  No unit tests as of yet (bad bad coder!)...
